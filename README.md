This just holds the stock names that are known based on the ticker; anything denoted with "*" means that we had looked up the name. If it has a name with a star, it means we tried to look up the name ourselves, if it states "None", then we either could not find the name, or we did not look for the name.
Each stock listed has its full name, followed by a colon (":"), followed by the short-name with the extension ".us.txt"; if you are entering a specific stock to be tested, only enter the short-name without the extension. For example, if you'd like to see the model done on " Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:opnt.us.txt ", then when asked for a specific stock, "opnt" should be entered.
